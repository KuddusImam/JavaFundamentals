		  Constructor Method: 
		  	1. only constructed with class name (can have access modifier). does not contain anything else
		  	2. executes only when we create the object.
		  	3. constrcutor method can only be called in a nother constrcutor method.
		  	4. in order to call constructor methods from parent class we use super keyword.
		  	5. in order to call constructor methods from current class we use this keyword.
		  	6. one constructor method can only call one constructor.
		  	7. if we created constructor method that is not default, means there is no default constructor
		  	8. if parent class does not have deafult constructor method but other constructors, then the parent' class constructor has to be called in child class FIRST		
		  	9. deaflut constructor in parent class is already called in child class by default
